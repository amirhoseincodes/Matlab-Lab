# MATLAB Homework 2 – Student Struct & Excel Export


## 📌 Overview

This project is a MATLAB assignment focusing on:


* Creating and managing structured data using `struct`.

* Performing type conversions between numbers and strings.

* Exporting structured data to an Excel file.

## 📁 Files

* **`student_struct_demo.m`**: Main script that defines student data, demonstrates type conversions, and exports data to Excel.

* **`student_data.xlsx`**: Excel file generated by the script containing the student data.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

* **Structs**: Organizing related data fields into a single structure.

* **Type Conversion**:

  * `num2str`: Convert numbers to strings.

  * `str2double`: Convert strings to numbers.

* **Excel Export**: Writing cell arrays to Excel using `writecell`.

  
## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.

2. Place `student_struct_demo.m` in your working directory.

3. Run the script:

   ```matlab
   student_struct_demo
   ```

4. Upon execution, `student_data.xlsx` will be created in the same directory.

## 📝 Notes

* Data is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

* No additional toolboxes are required.

* Compatible with MATLAB R2024a and later versions.
